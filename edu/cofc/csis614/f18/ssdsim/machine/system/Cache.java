 * A place for the system to store memoized operations. Logically, this would be RAM or some other type of memory that is much faster than disk (either HDD or SSD).

 * Stores the new values of the most recent n write operations.
 * If and when n is exceeded, the oldest item is evicted.
 * 
 * If a read or write request comes in for a memoized piece of memory, it reads from the cache instead of disk.
 * If a write request comes in for memoized information, the memoized value is overwritten and its time is reset.
